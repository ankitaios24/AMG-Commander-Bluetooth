BluetoothManager: Handles connection, communication, and data exchange with Bluetooth peripherals using CoreBluetooth.
Service Identifiers: Defines UUIDs for UART service and characteristics.
Delegate Protocols: Provides methods for managing connection states, handling received data, and discovering peripherals.
Example Commands: Demonstrates sending and receiving data as raw byte commands.
Designed for integration with Bluetooth devices using UART, it simplifies establishing connections, handling data transfer, and processing responses.
